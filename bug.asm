```assembly
mov ax, 1000h ; Load a large value into AX
add ax, bx  ; Add the content of BX to AX
```
This code snippet demonstrates a potential bug involving exceeding the maximum value of the register AX. If the sum of 1000h and the contents of BX exceeds FFFFh (the maximum value for a 16-bit register), an overflow will occur. The result will wrap around, leading to an unexpected and incorrect value in AX.  This is a silent error, meaning no error message is generated by the processor, making it harder to detect.
